# Airbnb data project
In this toy project, we will use Airbnb data to explore the factors that influence the price of a listing. We will use a variety of data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how Airbnb prices are determined. This knowledge can be used by Airbnb hosts to set competitive prices for their listings, and by travelers to find the best deals.

## Data

The data for this project is from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) website. This website provides a variety of data about Airbnb listings, including price, location, amenities, and reviews.

The data set we will use contains information about 20K+ Airbnb listings in Melbourne, Australia. Some of the features include in the data are:

Price: The nightly price of the listing
Room type: The type of room being rented (e.g., private room, entire home)
Number of bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the listing
Number of bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the listing
Amenities: A list of amenities that are available in the listing (e.g., kitchen, laundry, wifi)
Neighborhood: The neighborhood where the listing is located
Review score: The average review score for the listing

## Methods

We will use a variety of data science techniques to explore the factors that influence the price of an Airbnb listing. These techniques include:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): We will use EDA to get a better understanding of the data set. This includes looking at the distributions of the data, identifying outliers, and creating visualizations.
Machine learning: We will use machine learning to build a model that can predict the price of an Airbnb listing. We will evaluate different machine learning models and select the one that performs best.
Visualization: We will use visualization to communicate our findings to others. This includes creating charts, graphs, and maps.
